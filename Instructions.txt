HOW TO PLAY QUANTUM TIC-TAC-TOE:

There are 2 players, X and O.
Each player takes 2 turns placing tokens on the board.
The board is a regular tic-tac-toe, in which each square has a 3 by 3 board within
X goes first and places a token in one of the 81 squares
Then put’s another token in any other square except for the same large square
After X places two tokens, it’s O’s turn and O does the same
When you place you’re first token, it will be labelled as a subscript (X1, O2…)
When you link all these tokens together and come back to the original large square, you have formed an entanglement
When there is an entanglement, the player that didn’t form the entanglement chooses
which square they want to be rightfully theirs (Labelling the large square as their token)
The game continues until one of the players achieves a tic-tac
